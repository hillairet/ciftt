# CIFTT
> *CSV Input for Feature Triage and Tracking*

**CIFTT** turns your soul-crushing spreadsheets into structured GitHub issues and project entriesâ€”because if youâ€™re going to suffer, at least automate it.

---

## ðŸ§  Why use CIFTT?

- Bulk create or update GitHub issues from a CSV  
- ~Populate GitHub Projects (beta) fields like labels, assignees, and custom fields~ (coming soon-ish, probably)
- Save your sanity, or at least whatâ€™s left of it  

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ciftt.git
cd ciftt

# Run the thing
python ciftt.py input.csv myorg/myrepo
```

## ðŸ“„ CSV Format

Your CSV should include headers like:
```csv
title,body,labels,assignees,project,field_name_1,field_name_2,...
```

Only the title is necessary to create an issue and therefore only the title column is mandatory.

## ðŸ¤– Disclaimer

CIFTT is experimental. Like your last relationship. Use with caution.
